# **Smart Agriculture Advisory System Using Machine Learning**

## **Overview**
Smart Agriculture Advisory System is a machine learning-powered platform that provides farmers with actionable, data-driven insights to optimize crop selection and profitability. The system analyzes soil data, district-level weather trends, and market price data to recommend the most suitable crops while ensuring sustainable farming practices.

---

## **Features**
- **Real-time Crop Recommendation**: Suggests optimal crops based on soil pH, NPK values, rainfall, temperature, and market conditions.
- **Profitability Prediction**: Achieves **92% accuracy** in predicting profitability metrics for various crops.
- **Dynamic Sustainability Checks**: Ensures district-level sustainability thresholds are met using real-time updates.
- **Dockerized Deployment**: Includes a Dockerfile for easy deployment of the Flask application.
- **REST API Integration**: Provides endpoints for crop recommendations and profitability analysis.

## **Future Improvements**
1. **Integration with Government Data**:
   - Utilize real-time data from agricultural and meteorological government agencies to enhance predictions.
   - Collaborate on policy-level insights for sustainable farming practices.

2. **Advanced Research & Development**:
   - Develop machine learning models with deep learning techniques for weather forecasting and yield prediction.
   - Integrate advanced soil health parameters to improve recommendations.

3. **Scalability**:
   - Expand the system to support multi-region datasets and crop-specific recommendations.
   - Optimize database structures for high-performance querying and analytics.

4. **Mobile Application**:
   - Launch a farmer-friendly mobile application for easy access to recommendations and analysis.
